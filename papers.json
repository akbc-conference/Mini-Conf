We propose a novel unsupervised approach, VarSpot, to mine domain-dependent variational attributes present in unstructured text. The proposed approach reasons about both similarities and differences between entities and can easily scale to large sources containing millions of entities. We show the generality of our approach by performing experimental evaluation on three different domains. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and rule-based entity linkage systems by up to 4% F1 score when identifying duplicates, and up to 41% when identifying entity variations.","authors":["Varun Embar","Bunyamin Sisman","Hao Wei","Xin Luna Dong","Christos Faloutsos","Lise Getoor"],"keywords":[],"pdf_url":"","recs":[],"session":[],"title":"Contrastive Entity Linkage: Mining Variational Attributes from Large Catalogs for Entity Linkage"},"forum":"fR44nF03Rb","id":"fR44nF03Rb"},{"content":{"TLDR":"The vast and rapidly expanding volume of biomedical literature makes it difficult for domain experts to keep up with the evidence.
